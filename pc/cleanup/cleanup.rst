**Congratulations on completing the Nutanix Private Cloud lab track!**

.. note::

   Please be respectful and cautious when cleaning up VMs so as not to delete another user's resources.

After you have validated all completed labs with a proctor, please free up memory and IP resources on your cluster by doing the following:

- Do **NOT** delete your *Initials*\ **-WinToolsVM** or *Initials* **-LinuxToolsVM** VMs as they can be re-purposed in other labs
- Delete your *Initials* **-FiestaMySQL** deployment in Calm to clean up your **nodereact** and **MySQL** VMs
